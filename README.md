## Usage

Add to your ESPHome `.yaml`:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Soldered-Inkplate-ESPHome
      ref: main
```

### Parallel boards (Inkplate 6 V2 / V1 / 6 PLUS / 6 FLICK / 5 V2 / V1 / 4 / 10)

Parallel boards use the `inkplate` platform. They require an I2C bus (for the TPS65186 PMIC and PCAL6416A GPIO expander) but no SPI.

```yaml
esphome:
  name: my-inkplate6
  on_boot:
    priority: -100    # run after all components initialised
    then:
      - component.update: my_display

esp32:
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
  variant: esp32

psram:
  mode: quad
  speed: 40MHz

i2c:
  sda: GPIO21
  scl: GPIO22
  frequency: 100000

pca6416a:
  id: inkplate_pcal
  address: 0x20

display:
  platform: inkplate
  model: inkplate6v2      # inkplate6v2 | inkplate6v1 | inkplate6plus | inkplate6flick | inkplate4 | inkplate5v2 | inkplate5v1 | inkplate10
  id: my_display
  address: 0x48           # TPS65186 PMIC I2C address
  pca6416a_id: inkplate_pcal
  update_interval: 60s
  lambda: |-
    it.fill(COLOR_OFF);
    it.print(400, 300, id(my_font), COLOR_ON, display::TextAlign::CENTER, "Hello!");
```

The `on_boot` trigger is needed because the display does not draw automatically on startup - `component.update` kicks off the first refresh after all components have initialised.

#### Grayscale mode

Parallel boards support 8-level grayscale. Enable it in the display config:

```yaml
display:
  platform: inkplate
  model: inkplate6
  grayscale_mode: true
  lambda: |-
    it.filled_rectangle(0, 0, 100, 100, Color(3, 3, 3));  # mid-gray (0–7 range)
```

#### Partial update

Partial update refreshes only changed pixels - much faster than a full refresh but can accumulate ghosting over time. A full update clears ghosting.

```cpp
// inside a lambda or interval action
if (!id(my_display).is_refreshing()) {
    id(my_display).print(10, 10, id(my_font), "updated");
    id(my_display).display_partial();
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The first update after boot is always a full refresh - partial is blocked until a full update establishes a known panel state.

#### Configuration options

| Key | Required | Default | Description |
|-----|----------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | yes | - | Board model (see table above) |
| `pca6416a_id` | yes | - | ID of the PCAL6416A expander component |
| `address` | no | `0x48` | TPS65186 PMIC I2C address |
| `update_interval` | no | - | How often to trigger a full refresh |
| `full_update_every` | no | `1` | Force full refresh every N updates |
| `grayscale_mode` | no | `false` | Enable 8-level grayscale drawing |
| `rotation` | no | `0°` | Display rotation (0 / 90 / 180 / 270) |
| `lambda` | no | - | Drawing lambda |

### SPI boards (Inkplate 13 / 6 Color / 2)

```yaml
esphome:
  name: my-inkplate
  on_boot:
    priority: -100
    then:
      - component.update: my_display

spi:
  clk_pin: GPIOX     # GPIO38 for 13SPECTRA, GPIO18 for 6COLOR and 2
  mosi_pin: GPIOX    # GPIO40 for 13SPECTRA, GPIO23 for 6COLOR and 2

display:
  platform: inkplate_spi
  model: inkplate13         # inkplate13 | inkplate6color | inkplate2
  id: my_display
  update_interval: never    # trigger manually; use a time interval for auto-refresh
  lambda: |-
    it.fill(Color(255, 255, 255));
    it.print(10, 10, id(my_font), "Hello!");
```

`update_interval: never` is recommended for battery-powered use and for ACeP panels where refresh rate must be controlled. Use a `time` component or `interval:` block to trigger updates instead.

#### Inkplate 13 - partial update

Inkplate 13 supports refreshing a subregion without a full-panel redraw:

```cpp
// inside a lambda or interval action
if (!id(my_display).is_busy()) {
    id(my_display).filled_rectangle(x, y, w, h, Color(255, 255, 255));
    id(my_display).print(x, y, id(my_font), "updated");
    id(my_display).display_partial(x, y, w, h);
}
```

#### Configuration options

| Key | Required | Default | Description |
|-----|----------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | yes | - | Board model (see table above) |
| `update_interval` | no | - | How often to trigger a full refresh |
| `full_update_every` | no | `1` | Trigger full refresh every N updates |
| `rotation` | no | `0°` | Display rotation (0 / 90 / 180 / 270) |
| `lambda` | no | - | Drawing lambda |

Pin defaults match stock Inkplate hardware. Override any pin by adding e.g. `pin_rst: GPIO4` to the display block.

> [!CAUTION]
> Inkplate 13 enforces a **30 second minimum** between full refreshes. The component will reject a shorter `update_interval` at config validation time. ACeP panels can be permanently damaged by too-frequent refreshes.
